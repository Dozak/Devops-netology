root@vagrant:/home/vagrant/terraform# terraform workspace new stage
Created and switched to workspace "stage"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
